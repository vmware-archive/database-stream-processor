\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Incremental view maintenance (IVM) is an important and well-studied problem in
databases~\cite{gupta-idb95}.  The IVM problem can be stated as follows: given a database $DB$ and 
a view $V$ described by a query $Q$ that is a function of the database, i.e. $V = Q(DB)$, 
maintain the contents of $V$ in response to changes of the database, 
ideally more efficiently than by simply reevaluating $Q(DB)$ from scratch.  The goal is
to provide an algorithm that can evaluate $Q$ over the changes $\Delta DB$ applied
to the database, since in general the size of the changes is small $|\Delta DB| \ll |DB|$.  

This paper provides a new perspective by proposing a new definition
of IVM based on a streaming model of computation\footnote{Our model is inspired by Digital Signal 
Processing DSP~\cite{rabiner-book75}, applied to databases, hence the name \dbsp.}.  Whereas previous 
IVM solutions are based on defining a notion of a (partial) derivative of $Q$ with respect to its inputs,
our definition only requires computing \emph{derivatives of streams} as functions of time.
Derivatives of streams are always well-defined if the data computed on has a notion of difference
that satisfies some simple mathematical properties --- specifically, that it forms a commutative 
group.  (Fortunately, it has long been known that relational databases can be modeled
in such a way, e.g.~\cite{green-pods07, koch-pods10}.)

\dbsp has several attractive properties:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep, leftmargin=0pt, itemindent=0.5cm, label=\textbf{(\arabic{*})}]
\item it is \textbf{expressive}.  (a) It can be used to define
precisely multiple concepts: traditional queries, streaming computations, and incremental
computations.  (b) We have been able to express in \dbsp the full
relational algebra, computations over sets and bags,
nested relations, aggregation, flatmap, monotonic and nonmonotonic 
recursion, stratified negation, while-relational programs, window queries, 
streaming queries, streaming aggregation, and incremental versions of all
of the above.  In fact, we have built a \dbsp implementation of the 
complete SQL language (\refsec{sec:implementation}).
\item it is \textbf{simple}.
\dbsp is built entirely on elementary concepts such as functions and algebraic groups.
\item mathematically \textbf{precise}.  All the results in this paper have been
formalized and checked using the Lean 
proof assistant~\cite{moura-cade15}. 
\item it is \textbf{modular}, in the following sense:
(a) the incremental version of a complex query can be reduced
recursively to incrementalizing its component subqueries.
This gives a simple, syntactic,
heuristic-free algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{algorithm-inc}) 
that converts an arbitrary \dbsp query to its incremental form.
(b) Extending \dbsp to support new primitive operators is easy,
and they immediately benefit from the rest of the theory of
incrementalization.
An important consequence of modularity is that the theory
can be efficiently implemented, as we 
briefly discuss in \refsec{sec:implementation}.

The core concept of \dbsp is the \emph{stream}, which is used to model changes
over time. We use $\stream{A}$ to denote the type of infinite streams with values of 
type $A$. If $s \in \stream{A}$ is a stream, 
then $s[t] \in A, t \in \mathbb{N}$ is the $t$-th element of $s$, also referred to as the \emph{value of the stream at time $t$}.
A streaming operator is a function that
consumes one or more streams and produces another stream.  We show
streaming computations with diagrams, also called ``circuits'',
where boxes are computations and streams are arrows.  The following diagram
shows a stream operator $T: \stream{A} \times \stream{B} \to \stream{C}$,
consuming two input streams $s_0$ and $s_1$ 
and producing one output stream $s$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto,>=latex,minimum width=.5cm]
  \node[] (input0) {$s_0$};
  \node[below of=input0,node distance=.3cm] (dummy) {};
  \node[below of=dummy,node distance=.3cm] (input1) {$s_1$};
  \node[block, right of=dummy] (T) {$T$};
  \node[right of=T] (output) {$s$};
  \draw[->] (input0) -- (T);
  \draw[->] (input1) -- (T);
  \draw[->] (T) -- (output);
\end{tikzpicture}
\vspace{-.2cm}
\end{center}

We generally think of streams as sequences of ``small'' values,
such as insertions or deletions in a database.
However, we also treat the whole database as a \emph{stream of database
snapshots}.  We model a database as a
stream $DB \in \stream{SCH}$, where $SCH$ is the database schema.
Time is not wall-clock time, but counts
the transactions applied to the database. 
Since transactions are linearizable, they have a total order.
$DB[t]$ is the snapshot of the 
database contents after $t$ transactions have been applied.  

Database transactions also form a stream $\Delta DB$, this time a stream of \emph{changes},
or \emph{deltas} that are applied to the database.  The values of
this stream are defined by $(\Delta DB)[t] = DB[t] - DB[t-1]$, where ``$-$'' stands 
for the difference between two databases, a notion that we will soon make more precise.  
The $\Delta DB$ stream is produced from the $DB$ stream by 
the \emph{stream differentiation} operator $\D : \stream{A} \to \stream{A}$;
this operator produces as its output the stream of changes from its input stream; 
we have thus $\D(DB) = \Delta DB$.

Conversely, the database snapshot at time $t$ is the cumulative result of applying all 
transactions up to $t$: $DB[t] = \sum_{i \leq t} \Delta DB[i]$.
The operation of adding up all changes is the inverse of differentiation,
and is another basic stream operator, \emph{stream integration}: $\I: \stream{A} \to \stream{A}$.
The following diagram expresses the relationship between the streams $\Delta DB$ and $DB$: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto,>=latex,minimum width=.5cm]
  \node[] (input) {$\Delta DB$};
  \node[block, right of=input] (I) {$\I$};
  \node[right of=I] (output) {$DB$};
  \node[block, right of=output] (D) {$\D$};
  \node[right of=D] (end) {$\Delta DB$};
  \draw[->] (input) -- (I);
  \draw[->] (I) -- (output);
  \draw[->] (output) -- (D);
  \draw[->] (D) -- (end);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Suppose we have a query $Q : SCH \to SCH$ defining a view $V$.  What is
a view in a streaming model?  It is also a stream!  For each snapshot
of the database stream we have a snapshot of the view: $V[t] = Q(DB[t])$.
In general, given an arbitrary function $f: A \to B$, we define 
a streaming ``version'' of $f$, denoted by $\lift{f}$ 
(read as ``$f$ lifted''), which applies
$f$ to every element of the input stream independently.  
We can thus write $V = (\lift{Q})(DB)$.

Armed with these basic definitions, we can now precisely define IVM.  
What does it mean to maintain a view incrementally?  We claim that an
efficient maintenance algorithm needs to compute the \emph{changes} to 
the view given the changes to the database. Given a query $Q$, a key contribution of this paper is the definition of its \emph{incremental version} $\inc{Q}$ that uses stream integration and differentiation: $\inc{Q} \defn D \circ \lift Q \circ I$. The incremental version of the query maintains the changes to the view
$\Delta V \defn \D(V) = %\D(\lift{Q}(DB)) =
\D(\lift{Q}(\I(\Delta DB)))$, depicted graphically as:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[auto,>=latex,minimum width=.5cm]
  \node[] (input) {$\Delta DB$};
  \node[block, right of=input] (I) {$\I$};
  \node[block, right of=I, node distance=1.3cm] (Q) {$\lift{Q}$};
  \node[block, right of=Q, node distance=1.3cm] (D) {$\D$};
  \node[right of=D] (output) {$\Delta V$};
  \draw[->] (input) -- (I);
  \draw[->] (I) -- node (db) {$DB$} (Q);
  \draw[->] (Q) -- node (B) {$V$} (D);
  \draw[->] (D) -- (output);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The incremental version 
of a query is a \emph{streaming operator} which computes directly on changes
and produces changes.  The incremental version of a query is thus always
well-defined.  The above definition shows one way to compute a query
incrementally, but applying it naively produces an inefficient
execution plan, since it will reconstruct the database at each step.  In \refsec{sec:incremental}
we show how algebraic properties of the $\inc{\cdot}$ transformation can be used to
optimize the implementation of $\inc{Q}$. The first key property is that the
composition of queries can be incrementalized by composing the incremental
versions of its constituents, that is
$\inc{(Q_1 \circ Q_2)} = \inc{Q_1} \circ \inc{Q_2}$.  The second key
property is that essentially all primitive database operations
have efficient incremental versions.

Armed with this general theory of incremental computation, in \secref{sec:relational}  
we show how to model relational queries in \dbsp.  This immediately gives
us a general algorithm to compute the incremental version of any relational query.
These results were previously known, but they are cleanly modeled by \dbsp.  
\secref{sec:datalog} shows how stratified-monotonic recursive Datalog
programs can be implemented in \dbsp, and \secref{sec:nested} gives 
\emph{incremental streaming computations for recursive programs}. For example, given an implementation of 
transitive closure in the natural recursive way, our algorithm produces a program that efficiently maintains the 
transitive closure of a graph as the graph is changed by adding and deleting edges.

Due to space reasons, this paper omits most proofs.  A companion extensive
technical report\anonymize{~\cite{tr}} contains the proofs.  We have formalized the
entire \dbsp theory in the Lean proof assistant~\anonymize{\cite{dbsp-theory}}; 
our formalization includes machine-checked proofs of correctness 
for all the theorems stated in this paper.
