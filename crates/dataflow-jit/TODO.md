# Dataflow JIT Todo list

- [ ] Cleanup dataflow generation code
  - [ ] ~~Implement dynamic scoping so that we can have arbitrarily nested scopes~~
  - [ ] Implement a fixed level of nesting (minimum of 3, 5 probably gives us some good leeway)
  - [ ] Dynamically generated timestamp types (e.g. dynamically generate timestamp impls for `[u32; 5]` for 5 levels of nesting)
- [ ] More codegen debug checks, make sure that none of our pointers ever go out of bounds of any of our objects
- [ ] Add debug layout checks to all dataflow operators
- [ ] Validation infrastructure
  - [ ] Type checking, make sure all accesses and operations are properly typed
  - [ ] Well-formedness checks
  - [ ] Initialization checks, make sure that all relevant columns are properly initialized
  - [ ] Ensure that all things that require cloning are indeed cloned
    - If a string comes from an `input` row, it must be cloned before being stored anywhere 
- [ ] Row vectors
  - Instead of `OrdZSet<Row, Weight>` we want a custom collection that holds untyped values, a truly untyped `DynVec`
  - Requires changes in a lot of the more fundamental `Trace`-related traits
  - A switch to an internally iterated api could address this
- [ ] Implement `bincode::{Encode, Decode}` for row values
- [ ] Better layout algorithm
  - [ ] Add switch to make all null flags standalone booleans (that is, instead of bitsets make them each take up one byte)
  - [ ] Allow null niching strings
  - [ ] Spread out null flags as much as possible so that we have as many single byte flags as possible (they're more efficient to operate over)
- [ ] Optimizations of both the inner functions and the dataflows themselves
  - [ ] Eliminate const filters
  - [ ] Fuse filters, maps and filter maps
  - [ ] Turn non-mutating filter maps into filters
  - [ ] Linear operators can probably be fused with neg as well
  - [ ] Dataflow propagation, we can optimize things based off of their input attributes (e.g. a stream that comes
        from a `filter (x > 10)` tells us that `x` will always be greater than ten)
  - [ ] Automatically generate owned versions of functions
    - Automatically evaluate whether or not the owned version is actually better than the borrowed one
  - [ ] Once native row collections are implemented we can operate over them directly within our functions instead of
        using callback functions. This should be a significant speedup for things like filter and map
  - [ ] Auto-vectorization of operations over native row collections
  - [ ] When operating over persistent collections we can lazily deserialize/decode values, potentially benefiting projections
  - [x] Automatically deduplicate loads from input rows
  - [ ] Allow functions to be modified after they're built so they can be optimized
  - [ ] Constant folding
- [x] Add date and timestamp generation to proptesting so we can fuzz the relevant code
- [ ] Deduplicate functions, could help in reducing the number of functions we optimize and compile and could
      even allow us to deduplicate nodes with previously different inner functions
- [ ] Configurable difference/weight type, currently hardcoded to `i32`
- [ ] Dataflow planning optimizations
  - [ ] Push/pull differentiation and integration
  - [ ] Automatic incrementalization
  - [ ] Push/pull exchanges
  - [ ] Push/pull gathers
- [ ] Basic block parameters
  - [ ] Promote branched allocas to basic block args (or to `select`)
- [ ] Textual debugging for graphs
- [ ] Textual debugging for ir
- [ ] Add the ability to drop values (mainly strings) within ir
- [ ] Add a borrowed/static version of strings (maybe `&str` style `{ ptr, len }`)
