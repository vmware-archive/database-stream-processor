Bringing up a local instance of DBSP
===================================

To bring up a local DBSP instance and a Redpanda container, run the following:

```docker compose up``

This will bring up two containers: `dbsp` and `redpanda`.

Open your browser and you should now be able to see the pipeline manager dashboard on localhost:8081.
